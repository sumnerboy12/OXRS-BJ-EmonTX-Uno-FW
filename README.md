# EmonTX Arduino Shield Energy Monitor

Firmware for an Arduino Uno with [EmonTX Arduino Shield](https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/emontx-arduino-shield-smt/).

Monitors up to 4x current (CT) clamps plus a reference voltage, to calculate accurate energy flows.

Also supports diversion of excess energy to a remote load (via MQTT signalling) if you have local generation (solar, wind or water).
